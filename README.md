# MATLAB-Signals-Course
Welcome to my Signals course repository, where I bravely (or foolishly) decided to tackle MATLAB. If you're here willingly, congratulationsâ€”you fu*ked up, I mean you've officially signed up for a wild ride that only someone questioning their life choices would endure. But hey, who needs sanity anyway? Dive in and let the chaos begin!
